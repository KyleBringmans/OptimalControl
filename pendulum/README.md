### General Info
## Running the Simulink of the Practicum
In order to run the Simulink one must start by running pendulum_version1.m . This file contains the construction of all the used variables used in the Simulink files. Running it will bring the needed variable in the workspace. The matlab file also contains a step comparison used to illustrate the difference between tuned and untuned systems

The pendulum model with LQR controller and full state available can be found in pendulum_3a1_ez.slx

The pendulum model with LQR controller and full state not available can be found in pendulum_3a113.slx

The real-time Simulink diagram can be found in real_time_pendulum.slx
