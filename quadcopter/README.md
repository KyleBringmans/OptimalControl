Running it will bring the needed variable in the workspace. One must uncomment the particular value of Q & R that are to be tested to obtain the desired result. 

The quadcopter diagram with LQR & LQI controller and full state available can be found in quadcopter_version1.slx

The quadcopter diagram with LQR & LQI controller and full state NOT available can be found in quadcopter_kalman.slx

The quadcopter diagram using pole placement as state feedback can be found in quadcopter_pole_placement.slx
